## Set timestamps of checked-out files to match Git (Linux)
> [!tip]- Example Usecase
> 
> The anthopedia itself makes use of this within it's GitHub deploy workflow. This is because quartz has been configured to use the local file timestamps since quartz is being cloned at build time, which means quartz can't consult the git log for commit timestamps.

After cloning or pulling new files in from a git repository the timestamps for all files will be equal to the exact time that you cloned or pulled the repository / files.
If, for whatever reason, you wanted to set the timestamps of the local files to match what is represented in the git repository, you can create and run this script :
```sh
if [ $# = 0 ]; then
  git ls-files -z | xargs -0 sh "$0"
  exit $?
fi

for file in "$@"; do
  time="$(git log --pretty=format:%cd -n 1 \
                  --date=format:%Y%m%d%H%M.%S --date-order -- "$file")"
  if [ -z "$time" ]; then
    echo "ERROR: skipping '$file' -- no git log found" >&2
    continue
  fi
  touch -m -t "$time" "$file"
done
```
With this we can either:
- Update all tracked files in the repository by running it from within the repository with no arguments:
	```sh
	./update-ts.sh
	```
- Update specific files by specifying them as arguments:
	```sh
	./update-ts.sh index.html src/main.js
	```
- Update files within specific folders: 
	```sh
	git ls-files -z src/ tests/ | xargs -0 sh ./update-ts.sh
	```
- Update files that match a pattern:
	```sh
	git ls-files -z -- 'src/**/*.css' 'src/**/*.scss' | xargs -0 sh ./update-ts.sh
	```
